JFLAP 6.2 Changes 

Major:
-A User Control Parsing function has been added, where users can choose which production to apply in parsing.
-A CYK Parser and Multi-Run CYK Parser have been added, which are quicker than Brute Force parsing.
-JFLAP now implements a package of layout commands and algorithms that can be applied to automata.
-The pumping lemma game now allows the computer to go first, if desired.
-New languages have been added to the pumping-lemma game, and a few removed.  

Minor:
-Turing machines, by default, can no longer have transitions leading from final states, although this feature is available as an option.
-JFLAP now transforms the grammar into CNF even if the start variable derives lambda. Newly transformed grammars before would not accept the lambda String.
-Superfluous grammar rules are now removed during the transformation from a pushdown automaton to a context-free grammar.
-The default layout algorithm (GEM) has been improved such that vertices will now stay on the screen.
