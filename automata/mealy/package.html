<p>Provides the classes necessary for Mealy machines and Moore machies.
<p>A <code>MooreMachine</code> is merely a subclass of a <code>MealyMachine</code>
as a Moore machine is a special case of a Mealy machine. Thus, classes directly
related to Moore machines are subclasses of their Mealy machine counterparts. In
some cases, for a function, no class is written for the Moore machine. Instead, its
Mealy machine counterpart should be used.
<p>In addition to all the classes in this package, there are some other classes were
written. They are: {@link gui.editor.MealyTransitionCreator}, 
{@link gui.editor.MooreTransitionCreator}, {@link gui.editor.MooreStateTool},
{@link gui.editor.MooreArrowTool}, {@link gui.editor.MooreToolBox},
{@link gui.viewer.MooreStateDrawer}, {@link file.xml.MealyTransducer},
and {@link file.xml.MooreTransducer}.
