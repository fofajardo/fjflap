Building JFLAP
--------------
Compiling JFLAP requires Java 1.4, however, running JFLAP requires Java
1.3 for nearly everything except L-Systems rendering, which requires 1.4.  
The dependence on 1.4 will likely increase in the future, so beware.  To
compile this source on Unix, execute the following command from this
directory:

	javac JFLAP.java JFLAPplet.java

To run JFLAP in this way, then you can execute:

	java JFLAP.java

JAR Distribution
----------------
The JAR.py script will compile all the .class files into a JFLAP.jar
single file distribution.  Naturally, it requires successful compilation
of JFLAP into all the .class files, as described in the compilation
section.

	python JAR.py

This, of course, requires Python, and has been verified to work only with
Python 2.2 and higher, but it probably works on previous versions.

To run as a JAR:

	java -jar JFLAP.jar

Alternatively on OS X and on a correct configured Windows machine, you can 
double click the JFLAP.jar file and it should just work.

JFLAPplet
---------
The demo.html page shows a very simple example of embedding JFLAP as an
applet, and requires that a JAR file for JFLAP be built as described
above.

Javadoc
-------
The ./DOC script will create Javadoc documentation for all the JFLAP code
and packages in the javadoc directory.  Preferred is the javadoc that
comes with the 1.4 SDK; you may have to remove the "-breakiterator" line
to make it compatible with these early versions, plus there were some bugs
in the previous versions of javadoc that led to it failing to compile
javadoc.
