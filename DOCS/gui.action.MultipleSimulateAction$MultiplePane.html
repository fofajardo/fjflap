<P>This operator acts similarly to the "Fast Run" operator, except that it is able to run multiple inputs on a machine and acceptance traces cannot be viewed.  The inputs to run are entered in a table.  The left column of the table holds the inputs.</P>

<P>When the "Run Inputs" button is pressed, the right column of the table reports whether that input was accepted or not.  The "Clear" button will delete all inputs.  The "Enter Lambda" will blank the currently selected input, acting as though nothing were truly entered in that part of the table.</P>

<P>There may be an arbitrary number of inputs.  Similar to grammar input, when the last row of the table is edited, a new row will be added.  Additionally, the input entries will be remembered between separate multiple input runs; this is useful if a user wants to check a batch of inputs on a variety of machines without having to retype the inputs, which is useful for grading purposes (for example).</P>
